    "When Valera has some free time, he goes to the library to read. Today, he has exactly **$t$** free minutes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Valera has chosen **$n$** books in the library and numbered them from $1$ to $n$. For each book $i$, he estimated the time needed to read it as **$a_i$** minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Valera's Reading Rules:\n",
    "1. Valera chooses an arbitrary starting book $i$.\n",
    "2. He reads the books **one by one** in order: first book $i$, then book $i+1$, then book $i+2$, and so on.\n",
    "3. The process continues until:\n",
    "    * He finishes reading the last book ($n^{th}$ book).\n",
    "    * **Or** he runs out of free time and cannot finish the next book.\n",
    "4. Valera only reads books to the end. He will **not start** reading a book if he does not have enough time to finish it completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task:\n",
    "Find the **maximum number of books** Valera can read.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Format:\n",
    "* **The first line** contains two integers: $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$) and $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^9$) — the number of books and the total free minutes Valera has.\n",
    "* **The second line** contains a sequence of $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^4$), where $a_i$ is the time needed to read the $i^{th}$ book.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Format:\n",
    "* Print a single integer — the maximum number of books Valera can read.\n",

    "| `3 3`<br>`2 2 3` | `1` | Any single book is $\\le 3$, but any two together exceed 3. |\n",

    "### Complexity Analysis:\n",
    "* **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ should be targeted using a **Sliding Window** or **Two Pointers** approach.\n",
    "* **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ to store the array of reading times."

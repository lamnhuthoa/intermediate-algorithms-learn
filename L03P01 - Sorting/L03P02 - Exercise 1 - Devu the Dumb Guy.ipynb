    "# Devu, the Dumb Guy\n",
    "\n",
    "Devu is a dumb guy, his learning curve is very slow. You are supposed to teach him $n$ subjects, the $i$-th subject has $c_i$ chapters. When you teach him, you must teach all chapters of a subject continuously.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules:\n",
    "* His initial learning time per chapter is $x$ hours.\n",
    "* After teaching him a full subject, the time required for any chapter of the **next** subject decreases by exactly **1 hour**.\n",
    "* The learning time per chapter **cannot be less than 1 hour**.\n",
    "* You can teach the $n$ subjects in **any order**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task:\n",
    "Find the **minimum** amount of time (in hours) Devu will take to understand all subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Format:\n",
    "- The first line contains two integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \\le n, x \\le 10^5$).\n",
    "- The second line contains $n$ integers $c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n$ ($1 \\le c_i \\le 10^5$) — the number of chapters in each subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Format:\n",
    "- Output a single integer representing the minimum total time. (Note: The answer may exceed 32-bit integer limits)."
